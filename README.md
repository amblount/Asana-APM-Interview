# Asana-APM-Interview
Sticher user experience

### Background:
Podcasting has gained popularity recently thanks to the rapid growth in smartphone use and the rise of wildly popular content like Serial [https://serialpodcast.org/]. However, the technology that supports the creation and distribution of podcasts has evolved at a much slower pace compared to other mediums (think photos on instagram, videos on youtube, etc.) Stitcher [https://www.stitcher.com/] is one of the most widely used podcast platforms on the market right now.
 
### Assignment:

**Assumption:**

Let's say you're Stitcher's lead PM and assume listeners who interact with other users have a better overall experience.

1. What's the first feature you would build to test this assumption, and why? Clearly define your goals and your target users, and share your brainstorming list of alternates considered

2. How does it look and behave? (hint: wireframes are helpful)

3. Discuss tradeoffs, risks, and metrics for success. Are there times when the feature would be used a lot but it is still not a success?

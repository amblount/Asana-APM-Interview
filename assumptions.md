## What I understand about the current user experience for sticher podcast listeners

- Most users listen to podcasts while doing other things ex: cleaning up thier homes, or driving to work

- Most listeners get recommendations from their friends or other in thier social networks and are familiar with the concepts presented but are looking for 
deeper insights or maybe a new opinion

- A lot of the social interactions that occur about podcast content happens face to face via social interactions after the content
has been explored or listened to by at least one party involved. 

- If most of the users are exploring the sticher platform via audio only, we may need to intially focus on an audio user experience,
possibly something like Alexa voice or google home to allow the user to interact with the content using hands free methods.

- The most common sticker user is a 30 something, educated upper middle class user listening on their commute to work or their way
home from work.

- This (Most Common User - MCU) already has a playlist of content they have created via recommendations from friends or social networks they are already
a part of. The content is most likely work related.

- The experience would need to be an integrated experience because we are assumming that our primary user would be multitasking when they
are using the platform. Even if this MCU is commuting they would be reading emails or doing other taks son their phone while listening.

- Assumming the MCU is listening to sticher content on their mobile phone.

# How could you interact with other users while listening to a podcast?

- We are assuming that a sticher user has already found some content they like and are listening to that content.

- Introducing another user to the user listening to the same content, and recommending other show that the new user is listening to which the first user is unaware of.
Emotional responses to the content. I think having a forum where users could post about the way that the content is making them feel in real time would be super usual. Almost like creating an info map with autocomplete which would integrate with the listening experience. 

- Chat bot

- Machine learning to train the chat bot with leading questions and detailed responses

- After you have submitted an answer or before you have the option to read the forum and get ideas about how other people felt when they listened to the content.

- Transcription on the screen

- Before a user can recommend content to someone else, they need to digest how they personally feel about the content and that could take some time. 

- What signals would allow someone to take a deep dive into their feelings about content and make help them decide whether to recommend the content or not

- Doesn’t necessarily need to be a yes or no answer could be more like a scale of an emotional response trigger

- This content made me feel sad, and regretful and content because of this lived experience 

- Have the option to describe the lived experience in many ways, you could use images or giphys or videos of other songs that bring you back to that time

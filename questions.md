## A few clarifying questions: 

- When you are thinking of a user interacting with a listener are you including content creators or other listeners. I could define a user as an advertiser, listener or a content creator in this case. Initially, who are we trying to optimize the experience for?

- Which segment of the population are we building out the experience for? What is the age range, gender, income level, occupation variance of the user we are thinking about with this experience?

- How much information do we know about a single user, and how do we keep track of the way they are currently using the product and how often are they using the product?

- Do we have information about the way they are using the product? Many people listen to podcasts within their car, or while they are doing housework so they do not have a physical device in their hands while they are listening.

- Does the platform already integrate with existing social media accounts, like Instagram, twitter, or facebook?

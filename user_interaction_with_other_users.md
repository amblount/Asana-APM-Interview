## Possible ways for users to interact with other users

- instant messaging

- soundcloud like commenting referencing a specific point in the audio recording which displays comments from other users

- audio bot, which is available in the background of the playing podcast and which functions something like siri, stopping the
playback while you interact with the podcast.

- link other social media accounts ex: twitter, facebook, instagram and curate recommended content based on other listening habits and preferences.
You could recommend orders of listening and describe the days and times of others listening to get a feel of what sort of content places a person 
in a certain mood. Ex: comedy podcast around dinner time to make the family laugh and a weather podcast right before bed to preapre for the next day.

- Shape shifting: given people are preoccupied (MCU) when they are listening to the media we could offer a game like shape shifter where
the user views an index map which affiliates moods or categories and then instead of typing works to convey emotions they could use shapes or colors to indicate the way they feel about the
content at a certain time: -- EX: a user is listening to this american life and there is an experience about gentrificationa nd a family being pushed out of their 
family home. The listener feels sad and frustrated about this because they have witnessed this going on all around them. They want change but they
want to engage in conversdation about this matter. The user when they hear the sentence describing the tenant being pushed out press a 
triange button which maps to angry and an square button which maps to sad. They also scroll down to a blue color filter which changes the screen
to blue and this decribed the snetiment during that time. The user is feeling blue. The content creator on the other side could engage with this user
by reading their shape mappings and ask to dive deeper into the way they feel about the content, maybe they have more questions about solutions
or possible soutions that could be useful for the community to know about. The content creator could create a discussion board via the sticher platform
something like a facebook chat linking to tha creators page where users if logged in w/ facebook could comment on the facebook post of piece of contetnt and share their feelings
directly with the site. This woule enable user who are enagged with the content or the content creator on other social platforms to understand how
other listeners are feeing about the content and specifically which parts of the content weremost touching an why.
